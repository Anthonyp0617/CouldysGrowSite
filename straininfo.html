                <h1>White Widow</h1>
                <article class="strainfacts">
                    <h2>About White Widow</h2>
                    <img src="Resources/PICS/CG photos/whitewidowstockphoto.png" class=strainphoto>
                    <p> Legendary for its off-the-charts resin production, White Widow is a staple sativa-dominant hybrid with powerful energizing effects. It was produced by Dutch veterans Green House Seeds in the 1990s as a cross between Brazilian indica
                        and South Indian sativa landraces. At the time, the underground cannabis market consisted mostly of early hybrids like Northern Lights and Haze, but White Widow has since joined the ranks of these legendary strains, winning an
                        early High Times Cannabis Cup in 1995 and several awards since. Bred specifically for a high trichome count, White Widow is especially valued in the production of hash. This strain has an average THC composition of 20%, with some
                        phenotypes exceeding that amount.</p>
                    <p>Buds of White Widow are chunky and somewhat conical and tapered. The bud structure of the flowers are more sativa than indica, with a loose and fluffy texture that can be broken up somewhat easily despite its stickiness. The leaves
                        are spring green with few visible pistils.</p>
                    <p>When grown successfully, buds are entirely covered in long-stalked trichomes, lending the whitish-gray appearance that gives the strain its memorable name. White Widow is known for having a stinging, ammonia-like scent with some hints
                        of earthy pine. Breaking buds open gives off a more hashy, incense-like odor. The smooth smoke tastes similarly earthy -- users accustomed to fruity or tasty crossbreeds may be disappointed by White Widowâ€™s relative lack of flavor.
                        That said, White Widow is especially pungent when combusted, so smokers worried about discretion should plan accordingly.</p>
                    <p>White Widow can be grown from seed or from clone (achieved by planting clippings of mature and healthy plants). It is a mold-resistant strain, making outdoor cultivation an option -- although an almost Mediterranean climate with constant
                        temperatures between 70 and 80 degrees Fahrenheit works best. Despite a mostly sativa high, White Widow look much more indica during the vegetative stage: plants are bushy and wide, and rarely exceed 6 feet in height. The plants
                        flower within 9 weeks when grown indoors and are ready for harvest in early October when grown outdoors. Growers can expect about 37 to 55 grams (or about 1.3 to 2 ounces) per square foot of plant.</p>

                    <h2>About AK-47</h2>
                    <img src="Resources/PICS/CG photos/ak47profilepic.jpg" class=strainphoto>
                    <p>AK-47 is a Sativa-dominate hybrid with bright white coloring. Despite its violent name, the strain imparts a very mellow feeling and can even leave one stuck in a state of "couch lock". It also leads to increased creativity. For the
                        most part, however, AK-47 will leave you feeling uplifted, peaceful and euphoric. Many people enjoy using it while listening to music. Outside of dry mouth and eyes, the strain can also cause users to feel paranoid and sometimes
                        dizzy. Some users also experience minor headaches.</p>
                    <p>Many users take advantage of the strain's relaxing effect to relieve stress and anxiety. Others use it to take the edge off their chronic pains and aches. Insomniacs take 1-3 hits approximately an hour before bedtime to induce relaxation.
                        They report an increase in the number of restful nights following this routine.</p>
                    <p>Those suffering from bipolar disorder, depression and other mood disorders use this strain to help relax and regulate their mood. The strain is also used to increase appetite as well as ease nausea and vomiting</p>
                    <p>AK-47 plants are fairly tall and wide with large calyxes. The buds are dark yellowish-green with lots of crystals (trichromes) and fine red hairs. Many choose to grow AK-47 indoors in either soil or hydro, but it can be grown outside
                        in a mild climate. Ideally, temperatures should be kept below seventy-five degrees Fahrenheit. If grown at seventy-five degrees, the plants will produce the same yield, but the buds will open and become fluffy. The strain flowers
                        for eight to nine weeks. If grown outdoors, plants are ready for harvest in the middle of October. Under reasonable conditions, AK-47 plants can yield between 350 and 500 grams per square meter.</p>

                <article class="strainfacts">
                    <h2>Bubblegum</h2>
                    <img src="Resources/PICS/CG photos/bubblegumprofilefic.jpg" class=strainphoto>
                    <p>Bubblegum is an Indica dominant strain that was TH Seeds first entry into the seed community back in 1993 and has since gone on to win four High Times Cannabis Cups. It produces a powerful euphoric high that lifts moods and can render
                        users happily couch-locked.</p>
                    <p>The strain has also granted users an increase in creative juices along with its lazy Indica properties. Users can expect the usual negative effects when using Bubblegum - dry mouth and eyes, dizziness and some paranoia. There are a
                        few that also experience headaches from this strain.</p>
                    <p>The strain is most often used by those enduring stress, anxiety and mood related disorders; allowing them to find some much needed relaxation time. Due to the Indica traits Bubblegum is also good for pain relief and doting sleep upon
                        the insomniacs. It is used by those that deal with eating disorders, like anorexia, and chronic nausea or vomiting.</p>
                    <p>The strain grows as a shorter plant, usually between 120 to 160 centimeters, and is relatively easy to grow. Beginners can grow this strain but should be wary that plants need to be carefully clipped to control height, since this particular
                        strain has less side-branching. Bubblegum flowers between 55 to 60 days and can yield between 350 to 500 grams per square meter. It has a distinctive bubblegum aroma that is almost impossible to hide.</p>
