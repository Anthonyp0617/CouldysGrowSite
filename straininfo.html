                    <h2>About White Widow</h2>
                    <img src="Resources/PICS/CG photos/whitewidowstockphoto.png" class="strainphoto">
                    <p> Legendary for its off-the-charts resin production, White Widow is a staple sativa-dominant hybrid with powerful energizing effects. It was produced by Dutch veterans Green House Seeds in the 1990s as a cross between Brazilian indica
                        and South Indian sativa landraces. At the time, the underground cannabis market consisted mostly of early hybrids like Northern Lights and Haze, but White Widow has since joined the ranks of these legendary strains, winning an
                        early High Times Cannabis Cup in 1995 and several awards since. Bred specifically for a high trichome count, White Widow is especially valued in the production of hash. This strain has an average THC composition of 20%, with some
                        phenotypes exceeding that amount.</p>
                    <p>Buds of White Widow are chunky and somewhat conical and tapered. The bud structure of the flowers are more sativa than indica, with a loose and fluffy texture that can be broken up somewhat easily despite its stickiness. The leaves
                        are spring green with few visible pistils.</p>
                    <p>When grown successfully, buds are entirely covered in long-stalked trichomes, lending the whitish-gray appearance that gives the strain its memorable name. White Widow is known for having a stinging, ammonia-like scent with some hints
                        of earthy pine. Breaking buds open gives off a more hashy, incense-like odor. The smooth smoke tastes similarly earthy -- users accustomed to fruity or tasty crossbreeds may be disappointed by White Widowâ€™s relative lack of flavor.
                        That said, White Widow is especially pungent when combusted, so smokers worried about discretion should plan accordingly.</p>
